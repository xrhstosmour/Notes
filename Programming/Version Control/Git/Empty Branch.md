#git #branch

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a new, empty branch in your Git repository. This is particularly useful for setting up branches with entirely different content or history from your main branch, such as a `gh-pages` branch or any other situation where you want to start with a clean slate.

``` bash
git switch --orphan <new_branch>
```
