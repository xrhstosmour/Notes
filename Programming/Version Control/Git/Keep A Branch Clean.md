#git #fixup #autosquash #clean-branch

When working on a development branch, it's common to make minor fixes or adjustments to previous commits. To maintain a clean and understandable commit history, you can use the `--fixup` and `--autosquash` options with `git commit` and `git rebase`, respectively.

- **`--fixup`**: Use `git commit --fixup <commit>` to automatically mark your commit as a fix to a previous commit. Replace `<commit>` with the hash of the commit you're fixing.

- **`--autosquash`**: When rebasing interactively with `git rebase -i --autosquash`, Git will automatically organize and merge these `fixup` commits with their associated original commits.

This approach helps to streamline the commit history of a development branch before merging it into the master branch. However, it's important to exercise caution:

- **Avoid on Stable/Master Branch**: Do not use this technique on stable or master branches. Rebasing rewrites commit history, which can lead to complications, especially in projects with multiple contributors.
- **Ideal for Development Branches**: It's best suited for cleaning up a development branch prior to merging into the master branch, ensuring a tidy and coherent commit history.
