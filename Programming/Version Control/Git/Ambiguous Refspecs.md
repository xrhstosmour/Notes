When trying to push a branch named `<branch>` to a remote repository, the following error occurs: 

``` bash
git push origin <branch>:<branch>
error: src refspec <branch> matches more than one
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/<repository>.git'
```

This error is caused by the presence of both a branch and a tag with the name `<branch>` in the local Git repository. Git becomes unable to distinguish between the branch and the tag because they share the same name.

## Solutions

### 1. Specify the Push Refspec Explicitly

If you want to push the branch and maintain the tag with the same name, use the following command. This command specifies that you are pushing a branch, thereby resolving the ambiguity:

``` bash
git push origin refs/heads/<branch>:refs/heads/<branch>
```

### 2. Rename Existing Tag

If the tag named `<branch>` is no longer needed or can be renamed, follow these steps:

- **Create a New Tag with a New Name:**

``` bash
git tag <new_tag_name> refs/tags/<branch>
```

- **Delete the Old Tag Locally:**

``` bash
git tag -d <branch>
```

- **Delete the Old Tag from the Remote Repository:**

``` bash
git push origin :refs/tags/<branch>
```

- **Push the New Tag to the Remote Repository:**

``` bash
git push origin refs/tags/<new_tag_name>
```

This will effectively rename the tag `<branch>` to `<new_tag_name>` and clear up the ambiguity.
